# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End
**Project Description**
The WTWR project is a back-end server built using Node.js and Express. This server manages user data and clothing items, providing an API for a frontend application where users can add clothing items based on the weather and then like or dislike those clothing items.

The application includes:

- Full CRUD operations
- User authentication
- MongoDB integration for data persistence

**This servers API functionality handles:**

- User Management: Create, fetch, and update users
- Clothing Item Management: Add, fetch, and delete clothing items
- Like/Dislike Functionality: Enable users to like or dislike clothing items
- Error Handling: Handle invalid requests gracefully
- Authorization: Secure access to API routes

**The technologies used in this project are:**

- Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment
- Express.js: Framework for building web applications
- MongoDB: Database for storing user and clothing item data
- Mongoose: ODM library for MongoDB
- ESLint: JavaScript linter using the Airbnb style guide
- Prettier: Code formatting tool
- Nodemon: Hot reload during development
- Validator: Package for validating URLs and other fields


## Setting up the backend
- Clone the backend repository: git clone https://github.com/ParkerCase/se_project_express.git
- Follow the instructions in the backend's README.md to start the server.

Ensure the backend server runs on a different port (e.g., http://localhost:3001).


## Running the Project**
`npm run start` — to launch the server in production mode 

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

`npx nodemon app.js` - to start the server with Nodemon directly

## Repository
You can find the backend repository here:

### Testing
Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
